    <p>This Return & Refund Policy (“Policy”) governs all payments made to Part 1 (“Company”, “We”, “Us”,
        “Our”). By purchasing any subscription or accessing our Services, You (“User”, “Subscriber”, “Customer”)
        agree to be legally bound by this Policy.</p>
    <p>This Policy applies to all Users within Pakistan and internationally.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">1. GENERAL POLICY — STRICT NO-REFUND POLICY</h4>
    <p>All purchases made on the Part 1 Platform are FINAL, NON-REFUNDABLE, and NON-REVERSIBLE,
        irrespective of usage, performance, test results, subscription duration remaining, or user satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Under NO circumstances do We offer refunds, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change of mind</li>
        <li>Incorrect purchase</li>
        <li>Inability to use the Platform</li>
        <li>Performance issues in exams</li>
        <li>Technical issues caused by User’s device or internet</li>
        <li>Failed expectations</li>
        <li>Partial usage of the subscription</li>
        <li>Failure to cancel renewal</li>
        <li>Duplicate account creation</li>
        <li>Any personal, academic, or financial reason</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">2. DIGITAL SERVICES EXEMPT FROM REFUNDS</h4>
    <p>Our Services are classified as digital, educational, and instantly accessible content, which are legally
        exempt from refund obligations once delivered. Upon payment confirmation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User account is activated</li>
        <li>Access is granted instantly</li>
        <li>Digital content becomes available</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore, refunds cannot be issued under Pakistani consumer law for digitally delivered services already
        accessed or capable of being accessed.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">3. SUBSCRIPTION NATURE OF SERVICES</h4>
    <p>All subscriptions are:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Non-transferable</li>
        <li>Non-extendable without a new purchase</li>
        <li>Non-refundable even if unused or partially used</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The subscription does NOT auto-renew, and Users may choose to continue or discontinue after the 3-
        month period.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">4. PAYMENT DISPUTES & CHARGEBACKS</h4>
    <p>Because You explicitly agree to a strict no-refund model, initiating any chargeback, dispute, or reversal
        through:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Card issuer</li>
        <li>PayFast</li>
        <li>Any financial institution</li>
    </ul>
    <p>…shall be considered a breach of the Terms & Conditions.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide evidence proving digital service delivery</li>
        <li>Challenge any chargeback</li>
        <li>Suspend or permanently terminate User accounts involved in fraudulent disputes</li>
        <li>Pursue legal remedies available under Pakistan Electronic Transactions Ordinance (ETO) and Contract
            Act 1872
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">5. EXCEPTIONS (IF ANY)</h4>
    <p>There are NO exceptions to this No-Refund Policy unless:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The transaction was fraudulent (unauthorized card use), AND</li>
        <li>The User provides a valid police report or bank fraud verification</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All such cases undergo strict review. Approval is not guaranteed.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">6. ERRONEOUS OR FAILED TRANSACTIONS</h4>
    <p>If a payment is deducted but the subscription is not activated, the User must contact

        <li>Transaction reference ID</li>
        <li>Date and time of attempted payment</li>

    <p>If PayFast confirms a failed transaction, the amount will be reversed by PayFast, not by Us.
        This process may take 5–10 business days, subject to bank processing time.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">7. PRICING REVISIONS</h4>
